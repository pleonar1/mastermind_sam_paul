# mastermind_sam_paul
Sam and Paul's project

## Notes for technical work
- [sam] I did a little research about OOP and how to decide what classes you need
- https://blogs.msmvps.com/deborahk/applying-oop-to-simple-games-mastermind/
  - this blog writes down "nouns" and then uses them to define classes
    - Game
    - Board (I think we're playing without one)
    - Player1/Player2 (we only need one bc the second is the cpu)
    - Answer Pattern (doesn't need to perform actions - a property of the game)
    - Guess Pattern (we are relying on user input for guesses so we shouldn't need a separate class here)
    - Pegs (key to the physical game, but we probably don't need)


## DTR
#### Learning Goals
- Paul: we should both be on the same page for everything! We should be able to explain each part of the project individually
- Sam: Understand Git for Pairs

#### Strengths & Areas of Growth
- Sam: Strong in technical content
- Paul: Needs work with technical content but is willing to work

#### How do you learn best?
- Paul: Learn by doing. Prefer working in pairs but finds solo work helpful in the long run
- Sam: Learn best solo to solidify understanding, then coming together later

#### How do you communicate best?
- Paul: DTR should really help!
- Sam: Prefer written, but fine with either!

#### Scheduling restraints?
- Paul: not really!
- Sam: prefer 24 free hours during this weekend - prefer to work in the evenings

#### Tools to manage the project?
GitHub Projects? REPL, Atom, git, etc.

#### How should we solve feature-related problems?
Slack to schedule a time to meet, work it out together

#### When do we check in again?
