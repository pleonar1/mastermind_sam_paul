# mastermind_sam_paul
Sam and Paul's project

## Questions for check-in
- How do we test a method that requires user input to run?
  - try to write code such that methods take arguments and return something because they are easier to test
  - the alternative is using instance variables, but if the instance variable isn't what you expect it to be, it's harder to isolate
- Should we break up our classes further?
  - list out classes on a piece of paper
    - write names of methods under classes
  - ask: does this really belong together? (the line is fuzzy but this helps)
  - general guidelines: 100 lines of code per class is probably too many, but not necessarily


## DTR
#### Learning Goals
- Paul: we should both be on the same page for everything! We should be able to explain each part of the project individually
- Sam: Understand Git for Pairs

#### Strengths & Areas of Growth
- Sam: Strong in technical content
- Paul: Needs work with technical content but is willing to work

#### How do you learn best?
- Paul: Learn by doing. Prefer working in pairs but finds solo work helpful in the long run
- Sam: Learn best solo to solidify understanding, then coming together later

#### How do you communicate best?
- Paul: DTR should really help!
- Sam: Prefer written, but fine with either!

#### Scheduling restraints?
- Paul: not really!
- Sam: prefer 24 free hours during this weekend - prefer to work in the evenings

GitHub Projects? REPL, Atom, git, etc.

#### How should we solve feature-related problems?
Slack to schedule a time to meet, work it out together
